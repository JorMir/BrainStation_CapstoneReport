    "The datasets used for this analysis was acquired on the website [fbref.com](https://fbref.com/) who was provided the analytical data via [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/) a well respected source for soccer analytics. Specifically for our problem we are looking at the *Players Stats* under the [*Big 5 European Leagues*](https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/2020-2021/stats/players/2020-2021-Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats) from the soccer seasons beginning in 2010-2011 and ending in 2020-2021, 11 soccer seasons worth of data. The web developers at fbref were kind enough to add a *Share & Export* dropdown menu that allowed the tables for each season be exported as a `.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in our dataset is a snapshot of each player's season from the years 2010-2021. As our cutoff was last season, all player data should be complete and set in stone as the most recent season in our dataset has finished. We opted not to take the current season being played (2021-2022) as the data would be continuously updated week-after-week as the players play and could therefore change our analysis as the weeks pass. \n",

    "There should be no need for supplementary data sources excluding a possible case of missing values. If our datasets from fbref are missing values we will head to [transfermarkt.com](https://www.transfermarkt.com/), a leading source for 3rd party player stats and market valuations. This website allows you to search any given player across the world's leagues and search by season for their metrics.\n",

While this is a tedious process that we acknowledge can be done in a for loop, it's preferred this way as we'd like to ensure that we're reading in the correct dataset for each year. The way we will check that we didn't duplicate a season is if one player (we can find one using `.head()`) in our previous years dataset is in the next year's dataset and their `Age` column has increased by 1. This will let us know that we're on the right track reading in our seasons. \n",

    "Based on the players progressively aging as we loaded in later seasons, we can see that we've read in each season's dataset in the correct sequential order! Now that we've finished this, we can make note of some things we'll need to add, remove, or modify in the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I'd like to include in each of our datasets is the year in which the season began. This will help us when we group by player names as we'll see the seasons a player played through their average. If the average is a value in the 2016-2020 range we'll know they only recently began playing in the top 5 european leagues. A lower average in this column (ex. 2010-2014) will tell us the player recently stopped playing in the top 5 european leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns that can be removed are `Rk`, `Matches`, and `90s`. `Rk` will be removed as it was just the index from the tables we imported. `Matches` will be removed as it was HTML encoding on the website linking to the matches the respective player played in. Lastly, `90s` is simply the `Min` column (Minutes Played) divided by 90, therefore it can be considered redundant and removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third set of columns that need to be modified are `Player`, `Nation`, and `Comp`. The `Player` column contains two versions of the player, the first version is the player's name including any accents or symbols in their name. The second is the player's name in plain-text with a dash instead of spaces. We'll keep the plain-text version for clarity.  The columns `Nation` and `Comp` represent the nationality of the player and the competition (League) in which the player plays in. Each of these columns has a short-form abbreviation preceeding the word of interest. On fbref.com the abbreviation seems to be encoding for flag emojis. For data purposes the emojis are unnecessary and we only want the values after them. We'll perform `.str.split` to identify where in each entry the words should be split so as to remove the flag emojis and keep the part of interest to us (that is the player's nationality or the league they're playing in). We'll also rename the `Comp` column to `League` as it's clearer to most what it's representing rather than \"Competition\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as mentioned earlier, we'll need to address the duplicate columns names. These column names are duplicated because they originally were contained under a superheading organizing them under a \"Per 90 Minutes\" umbrella. We will keep the original column names but swap out the `.1` and add in a `_p90` tag instead. This way we can tell which metrics are measuring on a relative \"Per 90 Minutes\" scale by their column tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll perform these changes in a for loop going through each dataset individually before concatenating them all together."
