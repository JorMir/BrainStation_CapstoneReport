ReadMe

Hello Reader! This is a readme file for Jordan Miranda's capstone project that was submitted for BrainStation's Data Science course.

The focus on this project was to use Clustering, an Unsupervised Learning technique, to identify players of similar skill levels and playstyle.

The Jordan_Miranda_CapstoneReport folder contains the following:

- 1 readme file
- 1 folder titled "FormattedCapstoneData" that contains:
- 11 CSV files containing data on all players in the top five European soccer leagues over the course of 11 seasons (1 for each season)
- 5 Jupyter Notebooks
- 1 Technical Summary Business report in PDF format
- 3 Tableau images for visualization purposes included for the accompanying powerpoint (not found in this folder)
- 1 Tableau Workbook that contains the 3 aforementioned images

PLEASE NOTE: The Tableau workbook should only be opened after you've run all the Jupyter notebooks as the file used in Tableau is not initially provided in this folder.


The 5 Jupyter Notebooks should be run in the order they are numbered in the title:
1. Preprocessing & Cleaning
2. Initial EDA
3. Feature Engineering 
4. Modelling
5. Findings

PLEASE NOTE: In Notebook 3. Feature Engineering under Numeric Columns -> PK Conversion Rate you will be given an error attempting to run a chart showing the distribution. The error was left intentionally in the notebook, please continue running the cells beyond the error.

All files in this notebook can be run in the base anaconda environment (Python 3 kernel).


If you are having trouble accessing any of the files within this folder please contact Jordan at jordan.mir97@gmail.com.
